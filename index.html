        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> Hi, my name is Daniel Margosian. I'm a freshman in Computer Science
          at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My interests include
          mobile app development and hacking & security. I am an active memeber
          in my University's branch of ACM, the largest in the world. I participate
          in two special interest groups, SIGMobile and SIGPwny, in accordance
          with my interests. Relevant course work for Fall 2014 includes Caclulus
          III and Introduction to Computer Science. I plan on taking Data Structures,
          Discrete Structures, and Applied Linear Algebra in the Spring. Currently,
          I am enrolled in the honors section for Intro to CS and I am developing
          the android app for my team's project, <a href="http://newsmapper.me">NewsMapper.</a>
          You can check out my work on
          <a href="http://github.com/NewsMapper/Android-Client">Github.</a>
